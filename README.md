Project name : Recruitment Assignment 1

	* This program is written in Java,
	* It is used to evaluate integer numbers.
	
How to Compile and Run (execute) the program:
* download the file into a directory you want then launch it.
* Change directory on your terminal to where you extracted the files.
* To compile, run the following command on your terminal:
	javac PlatoonTest.java
* To execute, run the following command on your terminal:
	java -Xmx128M -Xms16M PlatoonTest
	
Assumptions
	* You must be running java on your terminal, to verify,  run the following command on your terminal:
		* java -version
		* javac -version
	* This program evaluate integer numbers.
	* All inputs must be integers
	* All inputs are hardcoded manually, you can review the code and change it.
